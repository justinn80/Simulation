        #
        # Available information:
        # - fitness_scores: list of (gatherer, fitness) tuples, sorted by fitness (best first)
        # - SURVIVAL_RATE: currently 0.05 (top 5% survive)
        # - len(fitness_scores): total population size
        #
        # Alternative selection strategies to consider:
        # 1. Tournament selection: pick random groups, take best from each
        # 2. Roulette wheel: probability proportional to fitness
        # 3. Rank-based: select based on rank, not raw fitness values
        # 4. Elite + random: guarantee best survive, then random selection
        # 5. Fitness-proportionate with scaling (linear/exponential)
        # 6. Hybrid approaches: combine multiple strategies
        #
        # Strategy hints:
        # - Pure elitism (current) can cause premature convergence
        # - Pure randomness loses good solutions
        # - Tournament selection often works well (simple + effective)
        # - Consider selection pressure: too high = less diversity, too low = slow evolution
